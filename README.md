# **Mission-to-Mars Project :military_helmet:

This assignment has the intention to automate a web browser by extracting data from different websites that store data about the Mission to Mars. Using a NonSQL database, the data is render in a web application created with Flask.

This project includes the following applications as well as outcome tools:
- Use _HTML elements_, as well as class and id attributes, to identify content for `web scraping`.
- Use _BeautifulSoup_ and _Splinter_ to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.
- Create a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
- Create a web application with Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
- Create an _HTML/CSS_ portfolio to showcase projects.
